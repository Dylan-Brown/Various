I've done plenty of Project Euler in other languages in the past, but I've never kept good track of them before.

So I am starting fresh on them with Python, hoping to become more familiar with the language.

If you've never done Project Euler problems before, I recommend them - see http://ProjectEuler.net

I would also recommend steering clear of this directory in order to avoid spoilers.
