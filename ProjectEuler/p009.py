Project Euler #9
Lewis J Ellis

A Pythagorean triplet is a set of three natural numbers, a < b < c, for which,

a^2 + b^2 = c^2
For example, 3^2 + 4^2 = 9 + 16 = 25 = 5^2.

There exists exactly one Pythagorean triplet for which a + b + c = 1000.
Find the product abc.
"""
# I guess this is trivialized by knowing the triplet 8, 15, 17 offhand and realizing 40 goes into 1000
print 8*15*17 * 25**3
